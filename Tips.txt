Dont try to move away or near to anything. Everything in its own place

Meditation
When observing everything in its place, observe what you are doing as well. This is in addition to everything else. Eventually YOU will disappear.

Excercise
If you want to stick with excercise, better to do not be doing something lazy atleast 2 hrs before excercising.

Work
Notice if you are going too fast in your mental processes. While that can be good when focussed, its not a good idea when you are jumping around.

When you notice yourself going to fast, physically and mentally slow down. Notice what you are doing. Follow your breath.

Slowing down and deliberately doing something will improve your rate of work because you'll waste a lot less time and only do things once.
