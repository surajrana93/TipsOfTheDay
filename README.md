# TipsOfTheDay
A tip of the day program written in python

This program is designed for you to store tips,learnings and reminders that you wont to be shown everyday. These 'Tips' are kept in a seperate file.

There is a specific format to follow to store the Tips file. Look at the example. It expects ---- delimiter and a category. We use the Main.py program to convert the Tips file into a feed for the Read.py program.

The Read.py program will show you two tips out of your list in a round robin fashion.

#Assumptions

Written for windows (though that can be changed).File names are hardcodes, but are easy to change in the program. All relevant files should be in the same folder.
